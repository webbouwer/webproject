WORK IN PROGRESS

## Introduction
As a webdeveloper you spend a lot of time exploring the web for info, codes, scriptlets, opensource plugins and software to re-use or hack into webprojects. This repository is an effort to reduce time in search and explore mode by keeping track of the most used stuff. If you like to add info make a commit or email me at oddsized@gmail.com.

[Most info can be found in the wiki pages](https://github.com/oddsized/webproject/wiki/Webproject-Wiki-Home)
