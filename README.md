## Introduction
As a webdeveloper you spend a lot of time exploring the web for info, codes, scriptlets, opensource plugins and software to reuse or hack into webprojects. This repository is an effort to reduce time in search and explore mode by keeping track of the most used stuff. If you would like to add info the best way is to make a commit.

[Most info can be found in the wiki pages](https://github.com/oddsized/webproject/wiki/Webproject-Wiki-Home)
