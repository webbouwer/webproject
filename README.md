# webproject
A collection of most used codes, plugins and software used by me to build the web

## Introduction
As a webdeveloper I spend a lot of time exploring the web for info, codes, scriptlets, opensource plugins, services and software to re-use or hack into webprojects or make my web developer life a bit less complicated. This repository is my effort to reduce time in search and explore mode by keeping track of most of the most used stuff :) 

## Issues & acknowlegement
I have stumbled on many posts stating '20 best plugins for ..' or '5 best practices for..', titles like that, wich have been very really helpfull at the time. One important problem is that most of these posts are not followed up by updates frequently enough to be of value for me as a webdeveloper in the long term. And sadly, some of those post are actually not posted for their value of content but just for marketing and advertisement goals. For posts, websites and authors bringing real and long term value I will make an effort to note them or create a special section inside this Webproject repository.

In the current setup I recognize a problem during updating the wiki pages without automatically updating the repository commits so people can not follow the wiki updates by following this repository. Any suggestions on this matter are welcome.
