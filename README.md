# webproject
A collection of most used codes, plugins and software used by me to build the web

## Introduction
As a webdeveloper I spend a lot of time exploring the web for info, codes, scriptlets, opensource plugins and software to re-use or hack into webprojects. I have stumbled on many posts stating '20 best plugins for ..' or '5 best practices for..', titles like that, wich have been very helpfull at the time. One problem though, I think most of those posts are not followed up by updates frequently enough to be of value for me as a webdeveloper in the long term. And sadly, some of those post are actually not posted for their value of content but just for marketing and advertisement goals. For posts, websites and authors bringing  real and long term value I will make a special section inside this Webproject repository.
